## üìä Key Metrics & Formulas

### Sales Funnel Mathematics
```
Monthly Sales = Daily Leads √ó 30 √ó Contact Rate √ó Meeting Rate √ó Close Rate
Monthly Revenue = Monthly Sales √ó Average Contract Value
Total Commission = Monthly Revenue √ó Commission Rate (2.7%)
```

### CAC & LTV Calculations
```
CAC = (Lead Costs + Salaries + Marketing Costs) √∑ Number of New Customers
LTV = Average Contract Value √ó Retention Multiplier (2.5x)
Target LTV:CAC Ratio = 3:1 (Minimum for healthy business)
```

### EBITDA Reverse Engineering
```
Required Revenue = Target EBITDA + Total Costs + Commissions
Required Sales = Required Revenue √∑ Average Contract Value
Required Leads = Required Sales √∑ (Contact Rate √ó Meeting Rate √ó Close Rate)
```

## üéÆ Interactive Controls

### Team Structure
- Total team size (5-50 people)
- Bench percentage (10-40%)
- Setter/Closer distribution

### Lead Generation
- Daily lead volume (50-500)
- Cost per lead ($10-100)
- Conversion rates at each stage

### Financial Parameters

- Behavioral bonus percentages

### Business Targets
- Daily EBITDA goals ($5K-20K)
- Performance thresholds
- Growth scenarios

## üß† Behavioral Psychology Features

### Speed Response Incentives
- **Research Basis**: 5-minute response = 21x higher conversion
