## 🔧 Technical Details

### Caching Strategy in Fast Dashboard

```python
# Revenue calculations cached for 5 minutes
@st.cache_data(ttl=300)
def calculate_gtm_metrics_cached(channels_json: str):
    # Expensive GTM calculations
    return metrics

# Commission calculations cached
@st.cache_data(ttl=300)
def calculate_commission_data_cached(...):
    # Uses DealEconomicsManager
    return commission_data

# Unit economics cached for 10 minutes
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def calculate_unit_economics_cached(...):
    # LTV, CAC, payback calculations
    return unit_econ
```

### Fragment Usage

```python
# Commission Flow as independent fragment
@st.fragment
def render_commission_flow():
    # Only this section reruns on changes
    # Rest of page stays static
    ...

# Period Earnings as independent fragment
@st.fragment
def render_period_earnings():
    # Independent of commission flow
    ...
```

### Lazy Loading Pattern

```python
# Heavy analytics only load on demand
with st.expander("Advanced Analytics", expanded=False):
    if st.button("Load Charts"):
        # Expensive charts only render when requested
        render_heavy_charts()
```
