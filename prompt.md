think about what specific data/things that are available either in books, online, etc. that have specific bases to generate the most extended, advanced and coherent compensation structure decision making / checklist / foundational thinking like Elon musk that uses both quantifiable and qualifiable data to model/structure performance based roles and keep people motivated while having amazing unit economics for large team structures that depend on each, the combination is not only for commission-only roles but for roles that require at least the closest possible reward for humans in order to measure the tasks and optimize for the specific things that position us in a much better spot rather than setting high commissions, high expectations just on results. Example: comp model that optimizes a team of sales to answer to leads quickly or to call new leads within 5 minutes, or to make sure they show up to the call or to book more appointments per call, or to increase likelihood of good follow-up, basically the basic behaviors that can't yet be automated by AI and we need to use behavioral psychology to incentivize them while also thinking about the math of the commission model structure and running simulations on it that are based on FIRST principles thinking.

1. i am thinking of a model that works in the next way:

Similarly to how football teams work we have people in the "banca" that are new or maybe people that haven't gotten to their specific KPI they go here, to get out of it they have to call old leads and get at least 5 meetings.

Then we have the compensation model for the appointment setters, i want to heavily incentivize them to call leads within the first 15 minutes of the lead coming in to claim them giving them a higher commission (help me here, a 5% additional, 10%, even test if behavior significance predicts change) if the lead closes, and also have incentives not only for them to have the behavior of calling a lot of leads quickly but also taking good care of them so having an incentive in which they at least have to give 2 good follow ups per lead even though needs polishing could work.

we need to make the model taking into consideration the initial prompt on first principles thinking.

we will basically need to do "Closer math" on the different stages from the booked call, the CAC to LTV ratio, reverse engineer how much EBIDTA we will have as a business on a daily basis, monthly basis, etc. in order to reverse engineer a specific number let's say we want $10,000 a day.

Help me craft the perfect prompt for this model in one shot also using the best practices from all of the context and sheets available.

It needs to be extremely granular, transparent math showing at the front-end.

Start by deeply analyzing my requirements, focusing on a model specific to our needs but that brings the best from the model templates we have and gathers specific data about the specific percentages and structure that we ahve in the analisis financiero which has more inforamtion about our specific business model

You are building a Python dashboard (using Lovable/Bolt) to simulate sales and commissions for the Allianz Optimaxx Plus retirement plan.  The model should be **fully transparent** and use Monte Carlo simulation to capture variability:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  Include the following details and requirements:

- **Commission Rate:** Set commission = 2.7% of the total plan value (monthly_contribution × 12 × term):contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.  Assume 70% of this commission is paid immediately (signing) and 30% after ~13 months:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  (If modeling a 25-year contract, note that some Allianz plans pay higher rates – e.g. 60% for a 25-year Proteccion plan:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} – and apply the appropriate percentage.)

- **Appointment Setter Incentives:** Give the setter an extra 5–10% commission if they respond to a new lead within 15 minutes and that lead closes.  Cite that contacting leads in **5 minutes** yields ~21× higher conversion than 30+ minutes:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  Also require each lead to receive at least 2 follow-up calls/messages.  These behaviors should increase that lead’s conversion probability in the simulation.

- **Funnel Conversion:** Model the sales funnel (Leads → Calls → Meetings → Sales).  Define variables or parameters for each stage’s conversion rate.  In each scenario, compute:
    - Plans sold = Leads × pct_contacted × pct_meeting × pct_closed.
    - Annual contract value (ACV) per sale (user input).
    - Total commission = 2.7% × (Leads × ACV) split 70/30 as above.
  Show the math for each (e.g. “If 100 leads, 80% are called, 50% agree to a meeting, 40% of those close: sales = 100×0.8×0.5×0.4 = 16 sales.”).

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Use random sampling (≥1000 trials) to vary key inputs (lead volume, conversion rates, admin fees, etc.).  Aggregate results into distributions of outputs (commission payouts, revenue, EBITDA).  Emphasize that Monte Carlo **“repeats the process thousands of times”** to get a realistic range:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.  Compute summary stats (mean, median, percentiles).

- **Interactive Inputs:** Provide user controls (sliders or inputs) for parameters such as daily lead count, conversion probabilities, contribution amount, agent count, salaries, and marketing costs.  Changing these should recalc all metrics and redraw charts immediately.

- **Visual Output:** Create clear charts of the results.  For example, plot the histogram of total commission and profit from the Monte Carlo runs.  Include time-series or bar charts for monthly revenue, EBITDA, etc.  Label axes and annotate formulas or key equations on the visuals.

- **CAC vs LTV:** Calculate Customer Acquisition Cost and Lifetime Value explicitly.  Show *CAC = (total sales + marketing expense) / #new customers* and *LTV = (average annual revenue per customer × customer lifetime)*.  Display the LTV:CAC ratio and highlight that a healthy business targets at least **3:1**:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.  Provide the formula breakdown so users see how CAC and LTV are computed.

- **Financial Targets:** Solve for sales needed to hit financial goals.  For instance, if target is \$10,000/day EBITDA, calculate required leads, conversions, or other inputs to achieve it.  Show all steps: DailyRevenue = #Sales×ACV, TotalCost = (commissions + salaries + overhead), then EBITDA = Revenue – Cost = \$10,000.  Solve for unknowns.

- **Transparency:** Present all calculations step-by-step.  For example, compute “Total Plan Value = \$5,000×12×25 = \$1,500,000; Commission = 2.7%×1,500,000 = \$40,500; Pay now = \$28,350; Pay later = \$12,150:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17},” and so on.  Every formula (even for CAC, LTV, EBIDTA) should be visible on the front-end for clarity.

Implement this as a complete self-contained prompt so that Lovable/Bolt will generate code for the interactive Monte Carlo model with all formulas and charts. Adjust percentages and numbers based on the actual Allianz Optimaxx Plus compensation data provided, and use first-principles math throughout.
