# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Your code pushed to a GitHub repository
3. A Streamlit Cloud account (sign up at https://streamlit.io/cloud)

## Setup Files (Already Done)

1. **requirements.txt** - Lists all Python dependencies
2. **.streamlit/config.toml** - Contains theme and server settings
3. **streamlit_app.py** - Entry point for Streamlit Cloud

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository, branch (main), and file (streamlit_app.py)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Configuration Settings**:
   - **Python version**: 3.9
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom subdomain if desired
   - **Advanced Settings**:
     - No need for secrets in this app
     - No need for special packages

4. **After Deployment**:
   - Your app will be available at https://[your-chosen-subdomain].streamlit.app
   - Streamlit Cloud automatically updates when you push changes to GitHub

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
3. Verify that streamlit_app.py correctly imports dashboard_improved_final.py
4. Check for any path-specific code that might not work in the cloud environment

## Local Testing

Before deploying, test locally with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This ensures your app works as expected before deploying to the cloud.
