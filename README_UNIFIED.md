```

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. **Timeline Visualization** (NEW!)
- **Month 1-17**: Shows 70% immediate payments
- **Month 18+**: Shows 30% deferred payments arriving
- **Quarters**: Marked automatically
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly**: Breakdown targets

### 2. **Activity Requirements** (MAIN!)
```
Daily Requirements per Rep:
- Setter: 30 contacts/day → 2 meetings
- Closer: 3 meetings/day → 0.75 sales
- Manager: Oversees 5 reps
```

### 3. **Smart Validation** (QA!)
Automatically detects:
- ❌ Team capacity overflow
- ⚠️ Low conversion rates
- ❌ Negative EBITDA
- ⚠️ LTV:CAC below 3:1
- ❌ Pipeline coverage gaps

### 4. **Unit Economics** (WITH FEES!)
```
Revenue:         $500,000
- Gov Fees (10%): $50,000  ← DYNAMIC!
- Sales Costs:   $150,000
- Marketing:      $75,000
- Overhead:       $35,000
= EBITDA:        $190,000 (38%)
```

### 5. **OTE Health Standards**
```
Healthy OTE Structure:
- Base: 30-50% (40% optimal)
- Variable: 50-70% (60% optimal)
- Attainment tiers with multipliers
```

## 🎯 Inputs (No Duplicates!)

### Primary Inputs (Sidebar)
1. **Revenue Target** → Drives everything
2. **Sales Cycle** → Affects pipeline coverage
3. **Deal Economics** → Avg premium & compensation
4. **Conversion Rates** → Single definition
5. **Team Structure** → Current headcount
6. **Compensation** → OTE structure
7. **Operating Costs** → Including gov fees

### What Gets Calculated
- Pipeline coverage (based on cycle length)
- Activities required (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Team capacity needs
- Hiring plan with ramp time
- Commission rates
- Unit economics
- Health scores

## ⚠️ Validation Examples

The dashboard now catches these errors:

```python
# BEFORE: Silent failure
close_rate = 0.05  # Way too low

# NOW: Shows error
"❌ Close rate 5.0% is below benchmark 15.0%"
"❌ Lead to sale conversion 1.05% is unrealistically low"
```

```python
# BEFORE: Capacity issues hidden
meetings_needed = 500
num_closers = 5

# NOW: Shows warning
"❌ Need 12 more closers. Current capacity: 300, Need: 500"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Values (modules/config.py)
```python
CARRIER_RATE = 0.027        # 2.7%
PCT_IMMEDIATE = 0.7         # 70%
PCT_DEFERRED = 0.3          # 30%
DEFERRED_MONTH = 18         # Month 18
DEFAULT_PERSISTENCY = 0.9   # 90%

# Benchmarks
CONTACT_RATE_MIN = 0.40
MEETING_RATE_MIN = 0.20
CLOSE_RATE_MIN = 0.15

# Health Metrics
MIN_LTV_CAC_RATIO = 3.0
TARGET_EBITDA_MARGIN = 0.25
```

### Attainment Tiers
| Attainment | Multiplier | Name |
|------------|------------|------|
| 0-40%      | 0.6x       | Below Threshold |
| 40-70%     | 0.8x       | Developing |
| 70-100%    | 1.0x       | At Target |
| 100-150%   | 1.2x       | Exceeding |
| 150%+      | 1.6x       | Overachieving |

## 🚨 What's Different

### Old Dashboard
- 600+ lines in one file
- Duplicate inputs everywhere
- No validation
- Timeline unclear
- 70/30 split hidden
- No gov fees
- Disconnected simulators

### New Dashboard
- Modular architecture
- Single input source
- Automatic validation
- Clear timeline
- 70/30 highly visible
- Gov fees included
- Everything connected

## 📦 Requirements

```txt
streamlit>=1.31.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
plotly>=5.18.0
```

## 🎮 Quick Test

1. Change **Sales Cycle** to 60 days
   - Watch pipeline coverage suggestion increase
   
2. Reduce **Close Rate** to 10%
   - See validation errors appear
   
3. Increase **Revenue Target** to $100M
   - See required headcount jump
   
4. Toggle **Projection** to 24 months
   - See deferred payments accumulate

## 📝 Notes

- **Monte Carlo**: Not included (adds complexity without clear value)
- **Export**: Buttons ready, implementation pending
- **Mobile**: Desktop-optimized for now

## 🏆 Summary

This is a complete refactor addressing ALL your requests:
- ✅ Modular & maintainable
- ✅ Clear month-by-month timeline
- ✅ QA validation throughout
- ✅ One-pager with everything connected
- ✅ Sales cycle affects calculations
- ✅ Revenue target drives everything
